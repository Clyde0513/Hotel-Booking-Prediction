# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis & Prediction
A comprehensive analysis of hotel booking patterns using data science and machine learning techniques, implemented in Jupyter Notebook.

📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover patterns and predict booking cancellations using machine learning. The entire analysis and implementation can be found in Hotel_booking_Project.ipynb.

🔍 Key Analysis Points
- Booking cancellation patterns
- Peak booking seasons
- Customer demographics
- Length of stay analysis
- Deposit type impact
- Market segment analysis

📈 Model Features
The machine learning model considers various factors including:
- Lead time
- Previous cancellations
- Room type
- Deposit type
- Customer type
- Seasonality

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python - Core implementation
Pandas - Data manipulation & analysis
Scikit-learn - Machine learning implementation
Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook - Development environment

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Clyde0513/Hotel-Booking-Prediction.git
cd Hotel-Booking-Prediction
```
2. Install dependencies
```
pip install scikit-learn1.4.1.post1, numpy1.26.4, scipy1.12.0, pandas2.2.1, matplotlib3.8.3, jupyterlab4.1.5
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Install Jupyter Notebook into your editor or vscode
```
jupyter notebook
```

📌 Key Findings
- Cancellation rate patterns
- Seasonal booking trends
- Customer booking behaviors
- Impact of pricing on cancellations
- Market segment analysis

🎯 Results
- Used a RandomForest model that fits a decision tree classifiers on various subsamples
- Improve prediction accuracy by 89% on a 69000 samples in the dataset
- Handles non-linearly data well through RandomForest model
